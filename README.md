**Steps to run the code:**
1) Install latest version of Python 3.
2) Install Pandas library.
3) To execute the program go to the directory of the program file in command prompt and use the command "python filename.py". Replace filename in the command with name of the program file being executed. In this case it is "lowest_price.py" and "filter_country.py".


*Note: Input csv file has to be in the same directory as that of the program file. Also, the output csv file will be created in the same directory after successful execution of the program.*
